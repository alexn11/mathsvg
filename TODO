TODO LIST:

0.0
- draw_bezier_curve + example
- parametric graph closed curve has wrong tangent at the extremities ?
- simplify doc generation - merge scripts
- labels/text + latex
- add picture in github and pypi
- add example selfsim-triforce.py
- add circle arc with arrow heads
- add example cantor bouquets
- improve doc
- doc compilation complaining about some block quote i dont understand why
- move torus into more-examples
- do a more-example section in the doc
- Python 2



0. Remove all the bugs




check duplicate in this file

do a list of requirements : python3 and svgwrite

https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-your-project

do the shishikura example!

1. 




- set a minimal separation angle between the vertexes of a potato

- pseudo parabolas, hyperbola arcs

- lemniscates, etc.

- labels, incl. latex formulas


LONG TERM:

- there seems to be some minor issue with parametric_curve, a way to make it look nicer?

- arrow tips at both end

- arrows at end of polylines, and interpolated open curve

- draw_compact_surface (position, size, genus, nb_punctures = 0, tilt = 0) (for genus <= 2) or draw sphere and draw torus
  maybe include the torus example in the class?


WIP:

- use of svg options

(MAYBE:)

- create a path_and_fill command to create filled shapes (need to understand how to build a path properly)

- how to use path . push () ?

- draw_halfline ?



DONE:
- new incompatible, but simpler, constructor
- modify the first sentence from pypi (how do you do that?)
- modify example for new version and test all of them
- create an example with multiple saving in different files - add a ref in the save documentation


- DEBUGGING: draw_interpolated_closed_curve is not smoothly closed: because the points on the potato are not equistributed


- in the doc: images to link to the code
- write down how to generate the documentation
- Put the doc on: https://readthedocs.org/
- next version is 0.0.2


create an email address for the project, put it in the code of conduct

  Needed: arrows

- draw_curved_arrow

- How to display the variable?
- how to generate the doc?
- how to make the lib work?
- docstring: variables, code, links to examples, images
- sphinx style of the doc
- include the examples in the doc
- remove "welcome!" from doc

- doc? the doc is the examples plus some explaining
  - make a list of which example uses what
  - explain a little random wavy line and any other non self explanatory functionalities

Rename this file

Test as a library

Add to github and to the python library repository (PyPI)



move the content of the README to the github README.md file

same for CONTRIBUTING etc.

note github might add the license automatically

see "how to create a python lib"
 there might be "requirements.txt" file to create and how to post it on PyPI etc.




- make a proper package
